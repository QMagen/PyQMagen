# Learning Effective Hamiltonian from thermodynamic data


we wish to propose a systematic approach of fitting thermodynamic data
which is unbiased and more efficient.


Now we have a first version demo where we show a proof-of-principle case
by learning the Hamiltonian of a XXZ Heisenberg chain.

The QMagen package can be installed locally via following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QMagen/HamiltonianLearning.git
cd HamiltonianLearning
pip install -e .
```

We also provide a DEMO in jupyter notebook
```bash
jupyter-notebook DEMO.ipynb
```
