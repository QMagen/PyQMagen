Description: # Learning Effective Hamiltonian from thermodynamic data
        
        
        we wish to propose a systematic approach of fitting thermodynamic data
        which is unbiased and more efficient.
        
        
        Now we have a first version demo where we show a proof-of-principle case
        by learning the Hamiltonian of a XXZ Heisenberg chain.

        ```bash
        jupyter notebook Demo.ipynb
        ```
        Too run the demo, make sure you have these packages properly intstalled.
