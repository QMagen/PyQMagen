Description: # Learning Effective Hamiltonian from thermodynamic data
        
        
        we wish to propose a systematic approach of fitting thermodynamic data
        which is unbiased and more efficient.
        
        
        Now we have a first version demo where we show a proof-of-principle case
        by learning the Hamiltonian of a XXZ Heisenberg chain.

        The QMagen package can be installed locally via following commands:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/QMagen/HamiltonianLearning.git
        cd HamiltonianLearning
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        We also provide a DEMO in jupyter notebook
        ```bash
        jupyter-notebook DEMO.ipynb
        ```
